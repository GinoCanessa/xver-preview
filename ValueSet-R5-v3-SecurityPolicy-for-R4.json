X.800 aka ISO 7498-2. Rule-based access control policies are intended to apply to all access requests by any initiator on any target in a security domain. Identity-based access control policies are based on rules specific to an individual initiator, a group of initiators, entities acting on behalf of initiators, or originators acting in a specific role. Context can modify rule-based or identity-based access control policies. Context rules may define the entire policy in effect. Real systems will usually employ a combination of these policy types; if a rule-based policy is used, then an identity-based policy is usually in effect also.</p>\n<p>An access control scheme may be based on access control lists, capabilities, labels, and context or a combination of these. An access control scheme is a component of an access control mechanism or &quot;service&quot;) along with the supporting mechanisms required by that scheme to provide access control decision information (ADI) supplied by the scheme to the access decision facility (ADF also known as a PDP).

See 42 CFR Â§ 2.32 Prohibition on re-disclosure. (a)Notice to accompany disclosure. Each disclosure made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by one of the following written statements: (1) This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by federal confidentiality rules ( 42 CFR part 2). The federal rules prohibit you from making any further disclosure of information in this record that identifies a patient as having or having had a substance use disorder either directly, by reference to publicly available information, or through verification of such identification by another person unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent of the individual whose information is being disclosed or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR part 2. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient for this purpose (see Â§ 2.31). The federal rules restrict any use of the information to investigate or prosecute with regard to a crime any patient with a substance use disorder, except as provided at Â§Â§ 2.12(c)(5) and 2.65; or (2) 42 CFR part 2 prohibits unauthorized disclosure of these records. https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/2.32</p>\n<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Example of marking requirement from SAMHSA FAQ Response to question 13:</p>\n<p>Would a logon or splash page notification on an HIOâ€™s portal that contains the Part 2 notice prohibiting redisclosure be sufficient to meet Part 2â€™s requirement that disclosures made with patient consent be accompanied by such a statement?</p>\n<p>No. Part 2 requires each disclosure made with written patient consent to be accompanied by a written statement that the information disclosed is protected by federal law and that the recipient cannot make any further disclosure of it unless permitted by the regulations (42 CFR Â§ 2.32). A logon page is the page where a user logs onto a computer system; a splash page is an introductory page to a web site. A logon or splash page notification on a HIO's portal including the statement as required by Â§ 2.32 would not be sufficient notification regarding prohibitions on redisclosure since it would not accompany a specific disclosure. The notification must be tied to the Part 2 information being disclosed in order to ensure that the recipient of that information knows that specific information is protected by Part 2 and cannot be redisclosed except as authorized by the express written consent of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by Part 2. https://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/laws-regulations/confidentiality-regulations-faqs</p>\n</div></td></tr><tr><td><a name=\"R5-v3-SecurityPolicy-for-R4-http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode-RefrainPolicy\"> </a><code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode</code></td><td>8.0.0</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActCode.html#v3-ActCode-RefrainPolicy\">RefrainPolicy</a></td><td>refrain policy</td><td><div><p>Conveys prohibited actions which an information custodian, receiver, or user is not permitted to perform unless otherwise authorized or permitted under specified circumstances.</p>\n<p><em>Usage Notes:</em> ISO 22600-2 species that a Refrain Policy &quot;defines actions the subjects must refrain from performing&quot;.

Foundational definitions of Confidentiality: From HL7 Confidentiality Concept Domain: Types of privacy metadata classifying an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability) according to its level of sensitivity, which is based on an analysis of applicable privacy policies and the risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to an individual or entity that could result if made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.</p>\n<p>Usage Note from HL7 Confidentiality code &quot;R&quot;: Confidentiality codes may be used in security labels and privacy markings to classify IT resources based on sensitivity to indicate the obligation of a custodian or receiver to ensure that the protected resource is not made available or disclosed to individuals, entities, or processes (security principals) unless authorized per applicable policies. Confidentiality codes may also be used in the clearances of initiators requesting access to protected resources.</p>\n<p>This metadata indicates that the receiver may be obligated to comply with applicable, prevailing (default) jurisdictional privacy law or disclosure authorization.</p>\n<p>Map: Definition aligns with ISO 7498-2:1989 - Confidentiality is the property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. Map: Partial Map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (3) Clinical Care: Default for normal clinical care access (i.e. most clinical staff directly caring for the patient should be able to access nearly all of the EHR). Maps to normal confidentiality for treatment information but not to ancillary care, payment and operations.</p>\n</div></td></tr><tr><td><a name=\"R5-v3-SecurityPolicy-for-R4-http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode-SecurityLabelMark\"> </a><code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode</code></td><td>8.0.0</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActCode.html#v3-ActCode-SecurityLabelMark\">SecurityLabelMark</a></td><td>Security Label Mark</td><td><div><p>An abstract code for displayed Security Label tags.</p>\n<p><em>Usage Note:</em> These marks may be based on any of the HL7 Security Labeling related codes from various code systems and values sets, which are organized according to the HL7 Privacy and Security Classification System into HL7 Security Observation Type Named Tag Sets and valued with codes associated with the HL7 Security Observation Value Tag Set Names.</p>\n</div></td></tr><tr><td><a name=\"R5-v3-SecurityPolicy-for-R4-http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode-SecurityPolicy\"> </a><code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode</code></td><td>8.0.0</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActCode.html#v3-ActCode-SecurityPolicy\">SecurityPolicy</a></td><td>security policy</td><td><div><p>Types of security policies that further specify the ActClassPolicy value set.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>obligation to encrypt</li>\n<li>refrain from redisclosure without consent</li>\n</ul>\n</div></td></tr><tr><td><a name=\"R5-v3-SecurityPolicy-for-R4-http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode-UPGRDLABEL\"> </a><code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode</code></td><td>8.0.0</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActCode.html#v3-ActCode-UPGRDLABEL\">UPGRDLABEL</a></td><td>upgrade security label</td><td><div><p>Custodian security system must declassify information assigned security labels by instantiating a new version of the classified information so as to break the binding of the classifying security label when assigning a new security label that marks the information as classified at a more protected level in accordance with applicable jurisdictional privacy policies associated with the target information.

Agency heads may approve the required use of CUI Portion marking on all CUI generated within their agency. As such, users should consult their agency CUI policy when creating CUI documents. When CUI Portion Markings are used and a portion does not contain CUI a â€œUâ€? is placed in parentheses to indicate that the portion contains Uncontrolled Unclassified Information. (Page 14)</p>\n<p>CUI Portion Markings are placed at the beginning of the portion to which they apply and must be used throughout the entire document. They are presented in all capital letters and separated as indicated in this handbook and the CUI Registry. The presence of EVEN ONE item of CUI in a document requires CUI marking of that document. Because of this, CUI Portion Markings can be of great assistance in determining if a document contains CUI and therefore must be marked as such. Remember: When portion markings are used and any portion does not contain CUI, a â€œ(U)â€? is placed in front of that portion to indicate that it contains Uncontrolled - or non-CUI - Unclassified Information.
