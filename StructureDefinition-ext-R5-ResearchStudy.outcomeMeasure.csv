","A variable measured during the study","An ""outcome measure"", ""endpoint"", ""effect measure"" or ""measure of effect"" is a specific measurement or observation used to quantify the effect of experimental variables on the participants in a study, or for observational studies, to describe patterns of diseases or traits or associations with exposures, risk factors or treatment.","A study may have multiple distinct outcome measures that can be used to assess the overall goal for a study. The goal of a study is in the objective whereas the metric by which the goal is assessed is the outcomeMeasure.
