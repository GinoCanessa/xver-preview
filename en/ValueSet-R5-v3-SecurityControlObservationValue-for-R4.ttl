X.800 aka ISO 7498-2. Rule-based access control policies are intended to apply to all access requests by any initiator on any target in a security domain. Identity-based access control policies are based on rules specific to an individual initiator, a group of initiators, entities acting on behalf of initiators, or originators acting in a specific role. Context can modify rule-based or identity-based access control policies. Context rules may define the entire policy in effect. Real systems will usually employ a combination of these policy types; if a rule-based policy is used, then an identity-based policy is usually in effect also.</p>\n<p>An access control scheme may be based on access control lists, capabilities, labels, and context or a combination of these. An access control scheme is a component of an access control mechanism or \"service\") along with the supporting mechanisms required by that scheme to provide access control decision information (ADI) supplied by the scheme to the access decision facility (ADF also known as a PDP).

See 42 CFR Â§ 2.32 Prohibition on re-disclosure. (a)Notice to accompany disclosure. Each disclosure made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by one of the following written statements: (1) This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by federal confidentiality rules ( 42 CFR part 2). The federal rules prohibit you from making any further disclosure of information in this record that identifies a patient as having or having had a substance use disorder either directly, by reference to publicly available information, or through verification of such identification by another person unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent of the individual whose information is being disclosed or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR part 2. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient for this purpose (see Â§ 2.31). The federal rules restrict any use of the information to investigate or prosecute with regard to a crime any patient with a substance use disorder, except as provided at Â§Â§ 2.12(c)(5) and 2.65; or (2) 42 CFR part 2 prohibits unauthorized disclosure of these records. https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/2.32</p>\n<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Example of marking requirement from SAMHSA FAQ Response to question 13:</p>\n<p>Would a logon or splash page notification on an HIOâ€™s portal that contains the Part 2 notice prohibiting redisclosure be sufficient to meet Part 2â€™s requirement that disclosures made with patient consent be accompanied by such a statement?</p>\n<p>No. Part 2 requires each disclosure made with written patient consent to be accompanied by a written statement that the information disclosed is protected by federal law and that the recipient cannot make any further disclosure of it unless permitted by the regulations (42 CFR Â§ 2.32). A logon page is the page where a user logs onto a computer system; a splash page is an introductory page to a web site. A logon or splash page notification on a HIO's portal including the statement as required by Â§ 2.32 would not be sufficient notification regarding prohibitions on redisclosure since it would not accompany a specific disclosure. The notification must be tied to the Part 2 information being disclosed in order to ensure that the recipient of that information knows that specific information is protected by Part 2 and cannot be redisclosed except as authorized by the express written consent of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by Part 2. https://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/laws-regulations/confidentiality-regulations-faqs</p>\n</div></td></tr><tr><td><a name=\"R5-v3-SecurityControlObservationValue-for-R4-http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode-RefrainPolicy\"> </a><code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode</code></td><td>8.0.0</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">  <a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActCode.html#v3-ActCode-RefrainPolicy\">RefrainPolicy</a></td><td>refrain policy</td><td><div><p>Conveys prohibited actions which an information custodian, receiver, or user is not permitted to perform unless otherwise authorized or permitted under specified circumstances.</p>\n<p><em>Usage Notes:</em> ISO 22600-2 species that a Refrain Policy \"defines actions the subjects must refrain from performing\".

Agency heads may approve the required use of CUI Portion marking on all CUI generated within their agency. As such, users should consult their agency CUI policy when creating CUI documents. When CUI Portion Markings are used and a portion does not contain CUI a â€œUâ€? is placed in parentheses to indicate that the portion contains Uncontrolled Unclassified Information. (Page 14)</p>\n<p>CUI Portion Markings are placed at the beginning of the portion to which they apply and must be used throughout the entire document. They are presented in all capital letters and separated as indicated in this handbook and the CUI Registry. The presence of EVEN ONE item of CUI in a document requires CUI marking of that document. Because of this, CUI Portion Markings can be of great assistance in determining if a document contains CUI and therefore must be marked as such. Remember: When portion markings are used and any portion does not contain CUI, a â€œ(U)â€? is placed in front of that portion to indicate that it contains Uncontrolled - or non-CUI - Unclassified Information.

Level 3 is appropriate for transactions that need high confidence in the accuracy of the asserted identity. Level 3 provides multifactor remote network authentication. At this level, identity-proofing procedures require verification of identifying materials and information. Authentication is based on proof of possession of a key or password through a cryptographic protocol. Cryptographic strength mechanisms should protect the primary authentication token (a cryptographic key) against compromise by the protocol threats, including eavesdropper, replay, online guessing, verifier impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks. A minimum of two authentication factors is required. Three kinds of tokens may be used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"soft\" cryptographic token, which has the key stored on a general-purpose computer,</li>\n<li>\"hard\" cryptographic token, which has the key stored on a special hardware device, and</li>\n<li>\"one-time password\" device token, which has symmetric key stored on a personal hardware device that is a cryptographic module validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or higher. Validation testing of cryptographic modules and algorithms for conformance to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, is managed by NIST.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Authentication requires that the claimant prove control of the token through a secure authentication protocol. The token must be unlocked with a password or biometric representation, or a password must be used in a secure authentication protocol, to establish two-factor authentication. Long-term shared authentication secrets, if used, are never revealed to any party except the claimant and verifiers operated directly by the CSP; however, session (temporary) shared secrets may be provided to independent verifiers by the CSP.

[OMB M-04-04 E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies]</p>\n<p>High authentication level of assurance indicates that the relying party may have very high confidence in the asserted identity's validity. Level 4 is for transactions that need very high confidence in the accuracy of the asserted identity. Level 4 provides the highest practical assurance of remote network authentication. Authentication is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. This level is similar to Level 3 except that only â€œhardâ€? cryptographic tokens are allowed, cryptographic module validation requirements are strengthened, and subsequent critical data transfers must be authenticated via a key that is bound to the authentication process. The token should be a hardware cryptographic module validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher overall with at least FIPS 140-2 Level 3 physical security. This level requires a physical token, which cannot readily be copied, and operator authentication at Level 2 and higher, and ensures good, two-factor remote authentication.</p>\n<p>Level 4 requires strong cryptographic authentication of all parties and all sensitive data transfers between the parties. Either public key or symmetric key technology may be used. Authentication requires that the claimant prove through a secure authentication protocol that the claimant controls the token. Eavesdropper, replay, online guessing, verifier impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented. Long-term shared authentication secrets, if used, are never revealed to any party except the claimant and verifiers operated directly by the CSP; however, session (temporary) shared secrets may be provided to independent verifiers by the CSP. Strong approved cryptographic techniques are used for all operations. All sensitive data transfers are cryptographically authenticated using keys bound to the authentication process.
