Agency heads may approve the required use of CUI Portion marking on all CUI generated within their agency. As such, users should consult their agency CUI policy when creating CUI documents. When CUI Portion Markings are used and a portion does not contain CUI a â€œUâ€? is placed in parentheses to indicate that the portion contains Uncontrolled Unclassified Information. (Page 14)</p>\n<p>CUI Portion Markings are placed at the beginning of the portion to which they apply and must be used throughout the entire document. They are presented in all capital letters and separated as indicated in this handbook and the CUI Registry. The presence of EVEN ONE item of CUI in a document requires CUI marking of that document. Because of this, CUI Portion Markings can be of great assistance in determining if a document contains CUI and therefore must be marked as such. Remember: When portion markings are used and any portion does not contain CUI, a â€œ(U)â€? is placed in front of that portion to indicate that it contains Uncontrolled - or non-CUI - Unclassified Information.
