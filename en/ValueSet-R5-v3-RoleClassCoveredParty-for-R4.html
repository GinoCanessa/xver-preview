A claimant must be either a person or organization, or a group of persons or organizations. A claimant is not a named insured or a program eligible.<br/><br/>**Discussion:** With respect to liability insurance such as property and casualty insurance, a claimant must file a claim requesting indemnification for a loss that the claimant considers covered under the policy of a named insured. The claims adjuster for the policy underwriter will review the claim to determine whether the loss meets the benefit coverage criteria under a policy, and base any indemnification or coverage payment on that review. If a third party is liable in whole or part for the loss, the underwriter may pursue third party liability recovery. A claimant may be involved in civil or criminal legal proceedings involving claims against a defendant party that is indemnified by an insurance policy or to protest the finding of a claims adjustor. With respect to life insurance, a beneficiary designated by a named insured becomes a claimant of the proceeds of coverage, as in the case of a life insurance policy. However, a claimant for coverage under life insurance is not necessarily a designated beneficiary.<br/><br/>**Note:** A claimant is not a named insured. However, a named insured may make a claim under a policy, e.g., an insured driver may make a claim for an injury under his or her comprehensive automobile insurance policy. Similarly, a program eligible may make a claim under program, e.g., an unemployed worker may claim benefits under an unemployment insurance program, but parties playing these covered party role classes are not, for purposes of this vocabulary and in an effort to clearly distinguish role classes, considered claimants.<br/><br/>In the case of a named insured making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that either a named insured or an individual insured has filed a claim for a loss. In the case of a program eligible, a role type code INJWKR (injured worker) subtypes the class to indicate that the covered party in a workers compensation program is an injured worker, and as such, has filed a "claim" under the program for benefits. Likewise, a covered role type code UNEMP (unemployed worker) subtypes the program eligible class to indicate that the covered party in an unemployment insurance program has filed a claim for unemployment benefits.<br/><br/>**Example:** A claimant under automobile policy that is not the named insured.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-RoleClass.html#v3-RoleClass-COVPTY">COVPTY</a></td><td>covered party</td><td>A role class played by a person who receives benefit coverage under the terms of a particular insurance policy. The underwriter of that policy is the scoping entity. The covered party receives coverage because of some contractual or other relationship with the holder of that policy.<br/><br/>*Discussion:*This reason for coverage is captured in 'Role.code' and a relationship link with type code of indirect authority should be included using the policy holder role as the source, and the covered party role as the target.<br/><br/>Note that a particular policy may cover several individuals one of whom may be, but need not be, the policy holder. Thus the notion of covered party is a role that is distinct from that of the policy holder.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-RoleClass.html#v3-RoleClass-DEPEN">DEPEN</a></td><td>dependent</td><td>**Description:** A role played by a person covered under a policy or program based on an association with a subscriber, which is recognized by the policy holder.<br/><br/>**Note:** The party playing the role of a dependent is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant). However, a dependent may make a claim under a policy, e.g., a dependent under a health insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy for wellness examines or if injured and there is no liable third party. In the case of a dependent making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that the dependent has filed a claim for services covered under the health insurance policy.<br/><br/>**Example:** The dependent has an association with the subscriber such as a financial dependency or personal relationship such as that of a spouse, or a natural or adopted child. The policy holder may be required by law to recognize certain associations or may have discretion about the associations. For example, a policy holder may dictate the criteria for the dependent status of adult children who are students, such as requiring full time enrollment, or may recognize domestic partners as dependents. Under certain circumstances, the dependent may be under the indirect authority of a responsible party acting as a surrogate for the subscriber, for example, if the subscriber is differently abled or deceased, a guardian ad Lidem or estate executor may be appointed to assume the subscriberaTMs legal standing in the relationship with the dependent.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-RoleClass.html#v3-RoleClass-INDIV">INDIV</a></td><td>individual</td><td>**Description:** A role played by a party covered under a policy as the policy holder. An individual may be either a person or an organization.<br/><br/>**Note:** The party playing the role of an individual insured is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant). However, a named insured may make a claim under a policy, e.g., a party that is the named insured and policy holder under a comprehensive automobile insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy if injured in an automobile accident and there is no liable third party. In the case of an individual insured making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that an individual insured has filed a claim for a loss.<br/><br/>**Example:** The individual insured under a comprehensive automobile, disability, or property and casualty policy that is the policy holder.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-RoleClass.html#v3-RoleClass-NAMED">NAMED</a></td><td>named insured</td><td>**Description:** A role played by a party to an insurance policy to which the insurer agrees to indemnify for losses, provides benefits for, or renders services. A named insured may be either a person, non-person living subject, or an organization, or a group of persons, non-person living subjects, or organizations.<br/><br/>**Discussion:** The coded concept NAMED should not be used where a more specific child concept in this Specializable value set applies. In some cases, the named insured may not be the policy holder, e.g., where a policy holder purchases life insurance policy in which another party is the named insured and the policy holder is the beneficiary of the policy.<br/><br/>**Note:** The party playing the role of a named insured is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant). However, a named insured may make a claim under a policy, e.g., e.g., a party that is the named insured and policy holder under a comprehensive automobile insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy e.g., if injured in an automobile accident and there is no liable third party. In the case of a named insured making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that a named insured has filed a claim for a loss.<br/><br/>**Example:** The named insured under a comprehensive automobile, disability, or property and casualty policy that is the named insured and may or may not be the policy holder.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-RoleClass.html#v3-RoleClass-PROG">PROG</a></td><td>program eligible</td><td>**Description:** A role played by a party that meets the eligibility criteria for coverage under a program. A program eligible may be either a person, non-person living subject, or an organization, or a group of persons, non-person living subjects, or organizations.<br/><br/>**Discussion:** A program as typically government administered coverage for parties determined eligible under the terms of the program.<br/><br/>**Note:** The party playing a program eligible is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant). However a program eligible may make a claim under program, e.g., an unemployed worker may claim benefits under an unemployment insurance program, but parties playing these covered party role classes are not, for purposes of this vocabulary and in an effort to clearly distinguish role classes, considered claimants.<br/><br/>In the case of a program eligible, a role type code INJWKR (injured worker) subtypes the class to indicate that the covered party in a workers compensation program is an injured worker, and as such, has filed a "claim" under the program for benefits. Likewise, a covered role type code UNEMP (unemployed worker) subtypes the program eligible class to indicate that the covered party in an unemployment insurance program has filed a claim for unemployment benefits.<br/><br/>**Example:** A party meeting eligibility criteria related to health or financial status, e.g., in the U.S., persons meeting health, demographic, or financial criteria established by state and federal law are eligible for Medicaid.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-RoleClass.html#v3-RoleClass-SUBSCR">SUBSCR</a></td><td>subscriber</td><td>**Description:** A role played by a person covered under a policy based on association with a sponsor who is the policy holder, and whose association may provide for the eligibility of dependents for coverage.<br/><br/>**Discussion:** The policy holder holds the contract with the policy or program underwriter. The subscriber holds a certificate of coverage under the contract. In legal proceedings concerning the policy or program, the terms of the contract takes precedence over the terms of the certificate of coverage if there are any inconsistencies.<br/><br/>**Note:** The party playing the role of a subscriber is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant). However, a subscriber may make a claim under a policy, e.g., a subscriber under a health insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy for wellness examines or if injured and there is no liable third party. In the case of a subscriber making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that the subscriber has filed a claim for services covered under the health insurance policy.<br/><br/>**Example:** An employee or a member of an association.</td></tr></table></li></ul></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The party playing the role of a dependent is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant). However, a dependent may make a claim under a policy, e.g., a dependent under a health insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy for wellness examines or if injured and there is no liable third party. In the case of a dependent making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that the dependent has filed a claim for services covered under the health insurance policy.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The dependent has an association with the subscriber such as a financial dependency or personal relationship such as that of a spouse, or a natural or adopted child. The policy holder may be required by law to recognize certain associations or may have discretion about the associations. For example, a policy holder may dictate the criteria for the dependent status of adult children who are students, such as requiring full time enrollment, or may recognize domestic partners as dependents. Under certain circumstances, the dependent may be under the indirect authority of a responsible party acting as a surrogate for the subscriber, for example, if the subscriber is differently abled or deceased, a guardian ad Lidem or estate executor may be appointed to assume the subscriberaTMs legal standing in the relationship with the dependent.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> The coded concept NAMED should not be used where a more specific child concept in this Specializable value set applies. In some cases, the named insured may not be the policy holder, e.g., where a policy holder purchases life insurance policy in which another party is the named insured and the policy holder is the beneficiary of the policy.</p>

A program eligible may be either a person, non-person living subject, or an organization, or a group of persons, non-person living subjects, or organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> A program as typically government administered coverage for parties determined eligible under the terms of the program.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The party playing a program eligible is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant). However a program eligible may make a claim under program, e.g., an unemployed worker may claim benefits under an unemployment insurance program, but parties playing these covered party role classes are not, for purposes of this vocabulary and in an effort to clearly distinguish role classes, considered claimants.</p>
<p>In the case of a program eligible, a role type code INJWKR (injured worker) subtypes the class to indicate that the covered party in a workers compensation program is an injured worker, and as such, has filed a &quot;claim&quot; under the program for benefits. Likewise, a covered role type code UNEMP (unemployed worker) subtypes the program eligible class to indicate that the covered party in an unemployment insurance program has filed a claim for unemployment benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A party meeting eligibility criteria related to health or financial status, e.g., in the U.S., persons meeting health, demographic, or financial criteria established by state and federal law are eligible for Medicaid.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> The policy holder holds the contract with the policy or program underwriter. The subscriber holds a certificate of coverage under the contract. In legal proceedings concerning the policy or program, the terms of the contract takes precedence over the terms of the certificate of coverage if there are any inconsistencies.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The party playing the role of a subscriber is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant).
