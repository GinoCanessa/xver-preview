### Lookup for FHIR R5 DeviceMetric for use in FHIR R4

The FHIR R5 resource is represented in FHIR R4 via the DeviceMetric resource.

Note that there is a profile defined to simplify use of this cross-version resource representation:[Profile: DeviceMetric](StructureDefinition-profile-DeviceMetric.md)

A computable version of the following element information is available in: [ConceptMapR5DeviceMetricElementsForR4DeviceMetric](ConceptMap-ConceptMap-R5-DeviceMetric-elements-for-R4-DeviceMetric.md)
