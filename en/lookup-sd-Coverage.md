### Lookup for FHIR R5 Coverage for use in FHIR R4

The FHIR R5 resource is represented in FHIR R4 via the Coverage resource.

Note that there is a profile defined to simplify use of this cross-version resource representation:[Profile: Coverage](StructureDefinition-profile-Coverage.md)

A computable version of the following element information is available in: [ConceptMapR5CoverageElementsForR4Coverage](ConceptMap-ConceptMap-R5-Coverage-elements-for-R4-Coverage.md)
