<p><em>Map:</em> Partially Maps to ISO 14265 Classification Term &quot;Emergency care provision to an individual subject of care&quot; described as &quot;To inform persons needing to provide health care services to the subject of care urgently, possibly needing to over-ride the policies and consents pertaining to Purpose 1 above.&quot; Purpose 1 is equivalent to HL7 treatment purpose of use: &quot;Clinical care provision to an individual subject of care&quot; described as &quot;To inform persons or processes responsible for providing health care services to the subject of care.&quot; The ISO description conflates both of the proposed specializations of HL7 ETREAT: break the glass and the typically broader access to health information normally available to providers who are provisioned for emergency workflows on a regular basis, e.g., Emergency Room providers. Examples of greater access than is normally accessible by providers based on the need to know are access to sensitive information for which access typically requires a patient's consent. This is not an override of a patient's dissent to disclose sensitive information in cases where the applicable policy waives the need for that consent to access this information. In US, Title 38 Section 7332 and 42 CFR Part 2 both permit emergency access without the need to override a patient's consent directive; rather, this access is a limitation to the patient's right to dissent from disclosure.</p>

<p><em>Usage Note:</em> The concept of care management is narrower than the list of activities related to more general organizational objectives such as provider profiling, education of healthcare and non-healthcare professionals; insurance underwriting, premium rating, reinsurance; organizational legal, medical review, auditing, compliance and fraud and abuse detection; business planning, development, and restructuring; fund-raising; and customer service.</p>

<p>There is a semantic gap in concepts. This classification term is described as activities, i.e., &quot;to inform persons&quot; or &quot;to inform processes&quot; rather than the rationale for performing actions/operations on information related to the activity.</p>

<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Use when describing these functions: 1. Monitoring a personâ€™s goals, needs, and preferences. 2.

Organizing and facilitating care activities and promoting self-management by advocating for, empowering, and educating a person. 4. Ensuring safe, appropriate, non-duplicative, and effective integrated care.</p>
<p>The goal is to clearly differentiate this type of coordination of care from HIPAA Operations by specifying that these actions on information are undertaken in the provision of healthcare treatment.</p>
<p>For similar uses of this concept, see SAMHSA Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking, which differentiates concepts of care coordination and case management for the provision of treatment as specifically distinct from activities related to health care delivery management and the operations of organizational entities involved in the delivery of healthcare.</p>
