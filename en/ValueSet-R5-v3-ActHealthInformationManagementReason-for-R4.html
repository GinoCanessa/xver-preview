Use of the data must be related to specified biomedical basic or applied research.

Includes override of organizational provisioning policies and may include override of subject of care consent directive restricting access.<br/><br/>*Map:* Partially Maps to ISO 14265 Classification Term "Emergency care provision to an individual subject of care" described as "To inform persons needing to provide health care services to the subject of care urgently, possibly needing to over-ride the policies and consents pertaining to Purpose 1 above." Purpose 1 is equivalent to HL7 treatment purpose of use: "Clinical care provision to an individual subject of care" described as "To inform persons or processes responsible for providing health care services to the subject of care." The ISO description conflates both of the proposed specializations of HL7 ETREAT: break the glass and the typically broader access to health information normally available to providers who are provisioned for emergency workflows on a regular basis, e.g., Emergency Room providers. Examples of greater access than is normally accessible by providers based on the need to know are access to sensitive information for which access typically requires a patient's consent. This is not an override of a patient's dissent to disclose sensitive information in cases where the applicable policy waives the need for that consent to access this information. In US, Title 38 Section 7332 and 42 CFR Part 2 both permit emergency access without the need to override a patient's consent directive; rather, this access is a limitation to the patient's right to dissent from disclosure.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-ActReason.html#v3-ActReason-CAREMGT">CAREMGT</a></td><td>care management</td><td>To perform analytics, evaluation and other secondary uses of treatment and healthcare related information to manage the quality, efficacy, patient safety, population health, and cost effectiveness of healthcare delivery. Explicitly excludes the use of information to organize the delivery of health care for care coordination and case management, or to provide healthcare treatment.<br/><br/>*Usage Note:* The concept of care management is narrower than the list of activities related to more general organizational objectives such as provider profiling, education of healthcare and non-healthcare professionals; insurance underwriting, premium rating, reinsurance; organizational legal, medical review, auditing, compliance and fraud and abuse detection; business planning, development, and restructuring; fund-raising; and customer service.<br/><br/>*Map:* Maps to ISO 14265 Classification Term "Health service management and quality assurance" described as "To inform persons or processes responsible for determining the availability, quality, safety, equity and cost-effectiveness of health care services."<br/><br/>There is a semantic gap in concepts. This classification term is described as activities, i.e., "to inform persons" or "to inform processes" rather than the rationale for performing actions/operations on information related to the activity.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-ActReason.html#v3-ActReason-CLINTRCH">CLINTRCH</a></td><td>clinical trial research</td><td>To perform one or more operations on information for conducting scientific investigations in accordance with clinical trial protocols to obtain health care knowledge.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-ActReason.html#v3-ActReason-CLINTRCHNPC">CLINTRCHNPC</a></td><td>clinical trial research without patient care</td><td>To perform one or more operations on information for conducting scientific investigations in accordance with clinical trial protocols to obtain health care knowledge without provision of patient care.

For example, an "off-label" drug used for cancer therapy administer to a specified patient population.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-ActReason.html#v3-ActReason-CLINTRL">CLINTRL</a></td><td>clinical trial</td><td>To perform health care as part of the clinical trial protocol.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-ActReason.html#v3-ActReason-CLMATTCH">CLMATTCH</a></td><td>claim attachment</td><td>To perform one or more operations on information for provision of additional clinical evidence in support of a request for coverage or payment for health services.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-ActReason.html#v3-ActReason-COC">COC</a></td><td>coordination of care</td><td>To perform one or more actions on information in order to organize the provision and case management of an individualâ€&trade;s healthcare, including: Monitoring a person's goals, needs, and preferences; acting as the communication link between two or more participants concerned with a person's health and wellness; organizing and facilitating care activities and promoting self-management by advocating for, empowering, and educating a person; and ensuring safe, appropriate, non-duplicative, and effective integrated care.<br/><br/>*Usage Note:* Use when describing these functions: 1. Monitoring a personâ€&trade;s goals, needs, and preferences. 2. Acting as the communication link between two or more participants concerned with a person's health and wellness. 3. Organizing and facilitating care activities and promoting self-management by advocating for, empowering, and educating a person. 4. Ensuring safe, appropriate, non-duplicative, and effective integrated care.<br/><br/>The goal is to clearly differentiate this type of coordination of care from HIPAA Operations by specifying that these actions on information are undertaken in the provision of healthcare treatment.<br/><br/>For similar uses of this concept, see SAMHSA Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking, which differentiates concepts of care coordination and case management for the provision of treatment as specifically distinct from activities related to health care delivery management and the operations of organizational entities involved in the delivery of healthcare.<br/><br/>*Map:* Maps to ISO 14265 Classification Terms: "Support of care activities within the provider organisation for an individual subject of care" described as "To inform persons or processes enabling others to provide health care services to the subject of care." "Subject of Care Uses" described as "To inform the subject of care in support of his or her own interests."</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-ActReason.html#v3-ActReason-COVAUTH">COVAUTH</a></td><td>coverage authorization</td><td>To perform one or more operations on information for conducting prior authorization or predetermination of coverage for services.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-ActReason.html#v3-ActReason-COVERAGE">COVERAGE</a></td><td>coverage under policy or program</td><td>To perform one or more operations on information for conducting activities related to coverage under a program or policy.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-ActReason.html#v3-ActReason-DISASTER">DISASTER</a></td><td>disaster</td><td>To perform one or more operations on information used for provision of immediately needed health care to a population of living subjects located in a disaster zone.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-ActReason.html#v3-ActReason-DONAT">DONAT</a></td><td>donation</td><td>To perform one or more operations on information used for cadaveric organ, eye or tissue donation.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="CodeSystem-v3-ActReason.html#v3-ActReason-DSRCH">DSRCH</a></td><td>disease specific healthcare research</td><td>To perform one or more operations on information for conducting scientific investigations to obtain health care knowledge.

<p><em>Map:</em> Partially Maps to ISO 14265 Classification Term &quot;Emergency care provision to an individual subject of care&quot; described as &quot;To inform persons needing to provide health care services to the subject of care urgently, possibly needing to over-ride the policies and consents pertaining to Purpose 1 above.&quot; Purpose 1 is equivalent to HL7 treatment purpose of use: &quot;Clinical care provision to an individual subject of care&quot; described as &quot;To inform persons or processes responsible for providing health care services to the subject of care.&quot; The ISO description conflates both of the proposed specializations of HL7 ETREAT: break the glass and the typically broader access to health information normally available to providers who are provisioned for emergency workflows on a regular basis, e.g., Emergency Room providers. Examples of greater access than is normally accessible by providers based on the need to know are access to sensitive information for which access typically requires a patient's consent. This is not an override of a patient's dissent to disclose sensitive information in cases where the applicable policy waives the need for that consent to access this information. In US, Title 38 Section 7332 and 42 CFR Part 2 both permit emergency access without the need to override a patient's consent directive; rather, this access is a limitation to the patient's right to dissent from disclosure.</p>

<p>Map:Partially Maps to ISO 14265 Classification Term &quot;Emergency care provision to an individual subject of care&quot; described as &quot;To inform persons needing to provide health care services to the subject of care urgently, possibly needing to over-ride the policies and consents pertaining to Purpose 1 above.&quot; Purpose 1 is equivalent to HL7 treatment purpose of use: &quot;Clinical care provision to an individual subject of care&quot; described as &quot;To inform persons or processes responsible for providing health care services to the subject of care.&quot;</p>
<p>The ISO description conflates both of the proposed specializations of HL7 ETREAT: break the glass and the typically broader access to health information normally available to providers who are provisioned for emergency workflows on a regular basis, e.g., Emergency Room providers. Examples of greater access than is normally accessible by providers based on the need to know are access to sensitive information for which access typically requires a patient's consent. This is not an override of a patient's dissent to disclose sensitive information in cases where the applicable policy waives the need for that consent to access this information. In US, Title 38 Section 7332 and 42 CFR Part 2 both permit emergency access without the need to override a patient's consent directive; rather, this access is a limitation to the patient's right to dissent from disclosure.</p>
<p>There is a semantic gap in concepts. This classification term is described as activities â€œto inform personsâ€? rather than the rationale for performing actions/operations on information related to the activity.</p>
