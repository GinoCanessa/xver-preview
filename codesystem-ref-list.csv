The use of the FormatCode specifies the technical format of the document. The FormatCode tends to reference the IHE Content Profile (Implementation Guide) that defines the use-case and constraints. The FormatCode is a further specialization more detailed than the mime-type. The FormatCode provides sufficient metadata information to allow any potential document content consumer to know if it can process and/or display by identifying a document encoding, structure and template.
