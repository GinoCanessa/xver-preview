","True if Task is prohibiting action","If true indicates that the Task is asking for the specified action to *not* occur.","The attributes provided with the Task qualify what is not to be done. For example, if a requestedPeriod is provided, the 'do not' request only applies within the specified time. If a requestedPerformer is specified then the 'do not' request only applies to performers of that type. Qualifiers include: code, subject, occurrence, requestedPerformer and performer.

In some cases, the Request.code may pre-coordinate prohibition into the requested action. E.g. 'NPO' (nothing by mouth), 'DNR' (do not recussitate). If this happens, doNotPerform SHALL NOT be set to true. I.e. The resource shall not have double negation. (E.g. 'Do not DNR').

doNotPerform should ONLY be used with Tasks that are tightly bounded in time or process phase.  E.g. 'Do not fulfill the midnight dose of medication X tonight due to the early morning scheduled procedure, where the nurse could reasonably check off 'Med X not given at midnight as instructed'.  Similarly, a decision support proposal that a patient should not be given a standard intake questionnaire (because the patient is cognitively impaired) would be marked as 'complete' or 'rejected' when the clinician preps the CarePlan or order set after reviewing the decision support results.  If there is a need to create a standing order to not do something that can't be satisfied by a single 'non-action', but rather an ongoing refusal to perform the function, MedicationRequest, ServiceRequest or some other form of authorization should be used.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension",0,*,"ele-1
