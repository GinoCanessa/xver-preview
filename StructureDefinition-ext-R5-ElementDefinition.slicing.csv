","This element is sliced - slices follow","Indicates that the element is sliced into a set of alternative definitions (i.e. in a structure definition, there are multiple different constraints on a single element in the base resource).

The set of slices is any elements that come after this in the element sequence that have the same path, until a shorter path occurs (the shorter path terminates the set).","The first element in the sequence, the one that carries the slicing, is the definition that applies to all the slices.
