(D) If authorized by an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction granted after application showing good cause therefor.

(Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description: Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles. A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy). These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine. A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy. When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information. This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.</p>\n<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements. For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain. 'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly. Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply. Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly. The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.</p>\n</div></td></tr><tr><td><a name=\"R5-v3-SecurityCategoryObservationValue-for-R4-http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode-_RoleInformationSensitivityPolicy\"> </a><code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode</code></td><td>8.0.0</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">  <a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActCode.html#v3-ActCode-_RoleInformationSensitivityPolicy\">_RoleInformationSensitivityPolicy</a></td><td>RoleInformationSensitivityPolicy</td><td><div><p>Types of sensitivity policies that apply to Roles.</p>\n<p><em>Usage Notes:</em> RoleSensitivity codes are used to bind information to a Role.confidentialityCode per organizational policy.

It is usually used to check the integrity of a data unit.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>SHA-1</li>\n<li>SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm)</li>\n</ul>\n</div></td></tr><tr><td><a name=\"R5-v3-SecurityCategoryObservationValue-for-R4-http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationValue-DENEX\"> </a><code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationValue</code></td><td>2.1.0</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">  <a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ObservationValue.html#v3-ObservationValue-DENEX\">DENEX</a></td><td>denominator exclusions</td><td><div><p>Patients who should be removed from the eMeasure population and denominator before determining if numerator criteria are met.

Level 3 is appropriate for transactions that need high confidence in the accuracy of the asserted identity. Level 3 provides multifactor remote network authentication. At this level, identity-proofing procedures require verification of identifying materials and information. Authentication is based on proof of possession of a key or password through a cryptographic protocol. Cryptographic strength mechanisms should protect the primary authentication token (a cryptographic key) against compromise by the protocol threats, including eavesdropper, replay, online guessing, verifier impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks. A minimum of two authentication factors is required. Three kinds of tokens may be used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"soft\" cryptographic token, which has the key stored on a general-purpose computer,</li>\n<li>\"hard\" cryptographic token, which has the key stored on a special hardware device, and</li>\n<li>\"one-time password\" device token, which has symmetric key stored on a personal hardware device that is a cryptographic module validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or higher. Validation testing of cryptographic modules and algorithms for conformance to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, is managed by NIST.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Authentication requires that the claimant prove control of the token through a secure authentication protocol. The token must be unlocked with a password or biometric representation, or a password must be used in a secure authentication protocol, to establish two-factor authentication.

Level 4 is for transactions that need very high confidence in the accuracy of the asserted identity. Level 4 provides the highest practical assurance of remote network authentication. Authentication is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. This level is similar to Level 3 except that only â€œhardâ€? cryptographic tokens are allowed, cryptographic module validation requirements are strengthened, and subsequent critical data transfers must be authenticated via a key that is bound to the authentication process. The token should be a hardware cryptographic module validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher overall with at least FIPS 140-2 Level 3 physical security. This level requires a physical token, which cannot readily be copied, and operator authentication at Level 2 and higher, and ensures good, two-factor remote authentication.</p>\n<p>Level 4 requires strong cryptographic authentication of all parties and all sensitive data transfers between the parties. Either public key or symmetric key technology may be used. Authentication requires that the claimant prove through a secure authentication protocol that the claimant controls the token.
