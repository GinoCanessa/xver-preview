<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Access control schemes are the type of access control policy, which is comprised of access control policy rules concerning the provision of the access control service.</p>
<p>There are two categories of access control policies, rule-based and identity-based, which are identified in CCITT Rec. X.800 aka ISO 7498-2. Rule-based access control policies are intended to apply to all access requests by any initiator on any target in a security domain. Identity-based access control policies are based on rules specific to an individual initiator, a group of initiators, entities acting on behalf of initiators, or originators acting in a specific role. Context can modify rule-based or identity-based access control policies. Context rules may define the entire policy in effect. Real systems will usually employ a combination of these policy types; if a rule-based policy is used, then an identity-based policy is usually in effect also.</p>
<p>An access control scheme may be based on access control lists, capabilities, labels, and context or a combination of these. An access control scheme is a component of an access control mechanism or &quot;service&quot;) along with the supporting mechanisms required by that scheme to provide access control decision information (ADI) supplied by the scheme to the access decision facility (ADF also known as a PDP). (Based on ISO/IEC 10181-3:1996)</p>

<p>This code permits a CDS system to algorithmically process information with this compartment tag for the purpose of alerting an unauthorized end user that masked information is needed to address an emergency or a patient safety issue, such as a contraindicated medication. The alert would advise the end user to &quot;break the glass&quot;, to access the masked information in an accountable manner, or to ask the patient about possibly masked information.</p>
<p>For example, releasing a list of sensitive medications with this compartment tag means that while the CDS system is permitted to use this list in its contraindication analysis, this sensitive information should not be shared directly with unauthorized end-users or end-user-facing Apps. Based on the results of the CDS system analysis (e.g., warnings about prescriptions) the end-user (e.g., a clinician) may still have the ability to access to the sensitive information by invoking &quot;break-the-glass protocol&quot;.</p>
<p><em>Usage Note:</em> A security label with the CDS system compartment may be used in conjunction with other security labels, e.g., a label authorizing an end user with adequate clearance to access the same CDS system compartment tagged information. For example, a patient may restrict sharing sensitive information with most care team members except in an emergency or to prevent an adverse event, and may consent to sharing with their sensitive service care team providers, e.g., for mental health or substance abuse.</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<p>In accordance with US 32 CFR Part 2002 and US Executive Order 13556 Controlled Unclassified Information, US Federal Agencies and their contractors are charged with classifying and marking certain information they create as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).</p>
<p>The following definitions, which are provided for context, are based on terms defined by the CUI Glossary https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/cui-glossary.html</p>
<ul>
<li>CUI is defined as &quot;information in any form that the Government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls.&quot;</li>
<li>Designating CUI occurs when an authorized holder, consistent with 32 CFR Part 2002 and the CUI Registry, determines that a specific item of information falls into a CUI category or subcategory.</li>
<li>The designating agency is the executive branch agency that designates or approves the designation of a specific item of information as CUI.</li>
<li>The authorized holder who designates the CUI must make recipients aware of the information's CUI status when disseminating that information.</li>

</ul>
<p>Once designated as CUI, US Federal Agencies and their contractors must assign CUI marks as prescribed by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) CUI Registry, and display marks as prescribed by the CUI Marking Handbook.</p>
<p>CUI markings must be displayed on hard copy, on containers, electronic media, and to end users for IT systems.</p>
<p>When HL7 content is designated as CUI, these computable markings can be interoperably conveyed using HL7 security label CUI tags, and may be included in HL7 text and narrative elements as human readable markings.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of CUI markings:</strong></p>
<p>CUI Custodians must enforce CUI security controls per applicable CUI policies. Federal agencies and their contractors must adhere to FISMA and NIST SP 800-53 security controls. Custodians, who are not Federal agencies or agency contractors, and are receivers of CUI, must adhere to NIST SP 800-171 security controls and those dictated by the Authorities indicated by the assigned CUI markings.</p>
<p>For most participants in US healthcare information exchange, including Federal Agencies and their contractors, additional controls are required by HIPAA Security standards for health information US 42 USC 1320d-2(d)(2) https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2016-title42/pdf/USCODE-2016-title42-chap7-subchapXI-partC-sec1320d-2.pdf</p>
<p>Federal Agencies and their contractors may be the CUI classifier of original CUI content; or a CUI derivative classifier, which reclassifies CUI content that has been aggregated with other CUI or Unclassified Uncontrolled Information (U) or dissembled from a larger CUI content; or declassifiers, depending on the designating agency's policies.</p>

<p>In accordance with US 32 CFR Part 2002 and US Executive Order 13556 Controlled Unclassified Information, US Federal Agencies and their contractors are charged with classifying and marking certain information they create as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).</p>
<p>The following definitions, which are provided for context, are based on terms defined by the CUI Glossary https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/cui-glossary.html</p>
<ul>
<li>CUI is defined as &quot;information in any form that the Government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls&quot;</li>
<li>Designating CUI occurs when an authorized holder, consistent with US 32 CFR Part 2002 and the CUI Registry, determines that a specific item of information falls into a CUI category or subcategory.</li>
<li>The designating agency is the executive branch agency that designates or approves the designation of a specific item of information as CUI.</li>
<li>The authorized holder who designates the CUI must make recipients aware of the informationâ€™s CUI status when disseminating that information.</li>
<li>Disseminating occurs when authorized holders provide access, transmit, or transfer CUI to other authorized holders through any means, whether internal or external to the agency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once designated as CUI, US Federal Agencies and their contractors must assign CUI marks as prescribed by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) CUI Registry, and display marks as prescribed by the CUI Marking Handbook.</p>
<p>CUI markings must be displayed on hard copy, on containers, electronic media, and to end users for IT systems.</p>
<p>When HL7 content is designated as CUI, these computable markings can be interoperably conveyed using HL7 security label CUI tags, and may be included in HL7 text and narrative elements as human readable markings.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of CUI markings:</strong></p>
<p>CUI Custodians must enforce CUI security controls per applicable CUI policies. Federal agencies and their contractors must adhere to FISMA and NIST SP 800-53 security controls. Custodians, who are not Federal agencies or agency contractors, and are receivers of CUI, must adhere to NIST SP 800-171 security controls and those dictated by the Authorities indicated by the assigned CUI markings.</p>

<p><em>Usage Note:</em></p>
<p>The ConfidentialMark (confidential mark) description is based on the HL7 Confidentiality Concept Domain: Types of privacy metadata classifying an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability) according to its level of sensitivity, which is based on an analysis of applicable privacy policies and the risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to an individual or entity that could result if made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.</p>
<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Confidentiality codes may be used in security labels and privacy markings to classify IT resources based on sensitivity to indicate the obligation of a custodian or receiver to ensure that the protected resource is not made available or disclosed to individuals, entities, or processes (security principals) unless authorized per applicable policies. Confidentiality codes may also be used in the clearances of initiators requesting access to protected resources.</p>

<p>Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract. Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided.</p>

<p><em>Usage Note:</em> A &quot;Privacy Mark&quot; is a Security Control Observation (SECCONOBS) named tag set as specified by the HL7 Privacy and Security Classification System (HCS). A Privacy Mark Named Tag Set is valued with a Privacy Mark leaf code &quot;tag&quot;, which is a member of the Security Control Observation Value (_SecurityObservationValue) tag set. Related Security Control Observation named tag sets are Purpose of Use, Obligation Policy, and Refrain Policy, each with their own Security Control Observation Value tag sets.</p>
<p>Foundational standard definitions: ISO 22600-3 Section A.3.4.3 - If present, the privacy-mark is not used for access control. The content of the privacy-mark may be defined by the security policy in force (identified by the security-policy-identifier) which may define a list of values to be used. Alternately, the value may be determined by the originator of the security-label. IEEE Security Glossary Compendium 93- CESG Memorandum No.1 Issue 1.2 Oct 1992 - Human readable word or phrase acting as an indicator of all or part of the security constraints that apply to a document so marked. NOTE: A machine readable representation of a marking.</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> While policies requiring creators, processors, custodians, senders or recipients apply, enforce, and persist applicable Privacy Marks may be dictated by a jurisdiction, organization or personal privacy, security, or integrity policy, those required to comply may be governed under different policies, so compliance may need to be enforced through trust contracts. For example, information content marked with GDPR related policies may require adherence by processors or recipients outside of the European Union. For this reason, this code system is likely to evolve with the inclusion of multiple policy domains needing to communicate encoded policies in a standard, interoperable manner.</p>

For example, in order to warn a recipient of 42 CFR Part 2 information of the redisclosure restrictions, the rule mandates that end users receive a written prohibition against redisclosure unless authorized by patient consent or otherwise permitted by Part 2. See 42 CFR Â§ 2.32 Prohibition on re-disclosure. (a)Notice to accompany disclosure. Each disclosure made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by one of the following written statements: (1) This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by federal confidentiality rules ( 42 CFR part 2). The federal rules prohibit you from making any further disclosure of information in this record that identifies a patient as having or having had a substance use disorder either directly, by reference to publicly available information, or through verification of such identification by another person unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent of the individual whose information is being disclosed or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR part 2. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient for this purpose (see Â§ 2.31). The federal rules restrict any use of the information to investigate or prosecute with regard to a crime any patient with a substance use disorder, except as provided at Â§Â§ 2.12(c)(5) and 2.65; or (2) 42 CFR part 2 prohibits unauthorized disclosure of these records. https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/2.32</p>
<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Example of marking requirement from SAMHSA FAQ Response to question 13:</p>
<p>Would a logon or splash page notification on an HIOâ€™s portal that contains the Part 2 notice prohibiting redisclosure be sufficient to meet Part 2â€™s requirement that disclosures made with patient consent be accompanied by such a statement?</p>
<p>No. Part 2 requires each disclosure made with written patient consent to be accompanied by a written statement that the information disclosed is protected by federal law and that the recipient cannot make any further disclosure of it unless permitted by the regulations (42 CFR Â§ 2.32). A logon page is the page where a user logs onto a computer system; a splash page is an introductory page to a web site. A logon or splash page notification on a HIO's portal including the statement as required by Â§ 2.32 would not be sufficient notification regarding prohibitions on redisclosure since it would not accompany a specific disclosure. The notification must be tied to the Part 2 information being disclosed in order to ensure that the recipient of that information knows that specific information is protected by Part 2 and cannot be redisclosed except as authorized by the express written consent of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by Part 2. https://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/laws-regulations/confidentiality-regulations-faqs</p>

<p>Privacy metadata indicating highly sensitive, potentially stigmatizing information, which presents a high risk to the information subject if disclosed without authorization. May be pre-empted by jurisdictional law, e.g., for public health reporting or emergency treatment. Foundational definitions of Confidentiality: From HL7 Confidentiality Concept Domain: Types of privacy metadata classifying an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability) according to its level of sensitivity, which is based on an analysis of applicable privacy policies and the risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to an individual or entity that could result if made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.</p>
<p>Usage Note from HL7 Confidentiality code &quot;R&quot;: Confidentiality codes may be used in security labels and privacy markings to classify IT resources based on sensitivity to indicate the obligation of a custodian or receiver to ensure that the protected resource is not made available or disclosed to individuals, entities, or processes (security principals) unless authorized per applicable policies. Confidentiality codes may also be used in the clearances of initiators requesting access to protected resources.</p>
<p>This metadata indicates that the receiver may be obligated to comply with applicable, prevailing (default) jurisdictional privacy law or disclosure authorization.</p>
<p>Map: Definition aligns with ISO 7498-2:1989 - Confidentiality is the property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. Map: Partial Map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (3) Clinical Care: Default for normal clinical care access (i.e. most clinical staff directly caring for the patient should be able to access nearly all of the EHR).

<p>CUI Marking Handbook https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf</p>
<p>CUI Portion Marking: Portion marking of CUI is optional in a fully unclassified document, but is permitted and encouraged to facilitate information sharing and proper handling of the information. Agency heads may approve the required use of CUI Portion marking on all CUI generated within their agency. As such, users should consult their agency CUI policy when creating CUI documents. When CUI Portion Markings are used and a portion does not contain CUI a â€œUâ€? is placed in parentheses to indicate that the portion contains Uncontrolled Unclassified Information. (Page 14)</p>
<p>CUI Portion Markings are placed at the beginning of the portion to which they apply and must be used throughout the entire document. They are presented in all capital letters and separated as indicated in this handbook and the CUI Registry. The presence of EVEN ONE item of CUI in a document requires CUI marking of that document. Because of this, CUI Portion Markings can be of great assistance in determining if a document contains CUI and therefore must be marked as such. Remember: When portion markings are used and any portion does not contain CUI, a â€œ(U)â€? is placed in front of that portion to indicate that it contains Uncontrolled - or non-CUI - Unclassified Information.

(Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description: Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles. A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy). These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine. A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy. When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information. This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.</p>
<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements. For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain. 'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly. Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply. Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly. The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.</p>

<p>A code representing U.S. Public Law 104-191 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule (45 CFR Section 164.522), which stipulates the process by which a covered entity seeks agreement from an individual regarding how it will use and disclose the individual's protected health information for treatment, payment, and health care operations is termed a &quot;consent.&quot; The Privacy Rule permits, but does not require, a covered entity to voluntarily obtain patient consent for uses and disclosures of protected health information for treatment, payment, and health care operations. Covered entities that do so have complete discretion to design a process that best suits their needs. From https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/264/what-is-the-difference-between-consent-and-authorization/index.html. The provisions relating to consent are largely contained in Section 164.522 Rights to request privacy protection for protected health information https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2017-title45-vol1/pdf/CFR-2017-title45-vol1-sec164-522.pdf.</p>
<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Used to indicate the legal authority for assigning security labels to governed information. In this case, where collection, access, use, or disclosure of healthcare information is governed by 45 CFR Section 164.522 use Ã¢â‚¬Å“HIPAAConsentÃ¢â‚¬? as the security label policy code.</p>
<p>Since information governed by a 45 CFR Section 164.522 has a level of confidentiality protection that is more stringent than the normal level of protection under HIPAA 45 CFR Section 164.506 Uses and disclosures to carry out treatment, payment, or health care operations https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2017-title45-vol1/pdf/CFR-2017-title45-vol1-sec164-506.pdf, assign the HL7 Confidentiality code Ã¢â‚¬Å“RÃ¢â‚¬? (restricted).</p>
