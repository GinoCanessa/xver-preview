","Base definition information for tools","Information about the base definition of the element, provided to make it unnecessary for tools to trace the deviation of the element through the derived and related profiles. When the element definition is not the original definition of an element - e.g. either in a constraint on another type, or for elements from a super type in a snap shot - then the information in provided in the element definition may be different to the base definition. On the original definition of the element, it will be same.","The base information does not carry any information that could not be determined from the path and related profiles, but making this determination requires both that the related profiles are available, and that the algorithm to determine them be available. For tooling simplicity, the base information must always be populated in element definitions in snap shots, even if it is the same.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension",0,*,"ele-1
