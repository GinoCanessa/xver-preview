<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Access control schemes are the type of access control policy, which is comprised of access control policy rules concerning the provision of the access control service.</p>
<p>There are two categories of access control policies, rule-based and identity-based, which are identified in CCITT Rec. X.800 aka ISO 7498-2. Rule-based access control policies are intended to apply to all access requests by any initiator on any target in a security domain. Identity-based access control policies are based on rules specific to an individual initiator, a group of initiators, entities acting on behalf of initiators, or originators acting in a specific role. Context can modify rule-based or identity-based access control policies. Context rules may define the entire policy in effect. Real systems will usually employ a combination of these policy types; if a rule-based policy is used, then an identity-based policy is usually in effect also.</p>
<p>An access control scheme may be based on access control lists, capabilities, labels, and context or a combination of these. An access control scheme is a component of an access control mechanism or &quot;service&quot;) along with the supporting mechanisms required by that scheme to provide access control decision information (ADI) supplied by the scheme to the access decision facility (ADF also known as a PDP). (Based on ISO/IEC 10181-3:1996)</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<p>In accordance with US 32 CFR Part 2002 and US Executive Order 13556 Controlled Unclassified Information, US Federal Agencies and their contractors are charged with classifying and marking certain information they create as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).</p>
<p>The following definitions, which are provided for context, are based on terms defined by the CUI Glossary https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/cui-glossary.html</p>
<ul>
<li>CUI is defined as &quot;information in any form that the Government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls.&quot;</li>
<li>Designating CUI occurs when an authorized holder, consistent with 32 CFR Part 2002 and the CUI Registry, determines that a specific item of information falls into a CUI category or subcategory.</li>
<li>The designating agency is the executive branch agency that designates or approves the designation of a specific item of information as CUI.</li>
<li>The authorized holder who designates the CUI must make recipients aware of the information's CUI status when disseminating that information.</li>
<li>â€¢ Disseminating occurs when authorized holders provide access, transmit, or transfer CUI to other authorized holders through any means, whether internal or external to the agency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once designated as CUI, US Federal Agencies and their contractors must assign CUI marks as prescribed by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) CUI Registry, and display marks as prescribed by the CUI Marking Handbook.</p>
<p>CUI markings must be displayed on hard copy, on containers, electronic media, and to end users for IT systems.</p>
<p>When HL7 content is designated as CUI, these computable markings can be interoperably conveyed using HL7 security label CUI tags, and may be included in HL7 text and narrative elements as human readable markings.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of CUI markings:</strong></p>
<p>CUI Custodians must enforce CUI security controls per applicable CUI policies. Federal agencies and their contractors must adhere to FISMA and NIST SP 800-53 security controls. Custodians, who are not Federal agencies or agency contractors, and are receivers of CUI, must adhere to NIST SP 800-171 security controls and those dictated by the Authorities indicated by the assigned CUI markings.</p>
<p>For most participants in US healthcare information exchange, including Federal Agencies and their contractors, additional controls are required by HIPAA Security standards for health information US 42 USC 1320d-2(d)(2) https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2016-title42/pdf/USCODE-2016-title42-chap7-subchapXI-partC-sec1320d-2.pdf</p>
<p>Federal Agencies and their contractors may be the CUI classifier of original CUI content; or a CUI derivative classifier, which reclassifies CUI content that has been aggregated with other CUI or Unclassified Uncontrolled Information (U) or dissembled from a larger CUI content; or declassifiers, depending on the designating agency's policies.</p>
<p>Applicable CUI policies include the following and any future applicable updates to policies or laws related to CUI:</p>

<p><em>Usage Note:</em></p>
<p>The ConfidentialMark (confidential mark) description is based on the HL7 Confidentiality Concept Domain: Types of privacy metadata classifying an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability) according to its level of sensitivity, which is based on an analysis of applicable privacy policies and the risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to an individual or entity that could result if made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.</p>
<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Confidentiality codes may be used in security labels and privacy markings to classify IT resources based on sensitivity to indicate the obligation of a custodian or receiver to ensure that the protected resource is not made available or disclosed to individuals, entities, or processes (security principals) unless authorized per applicable policies. Confidentiality codes may also be used in the clearances of initiators requesting access to protected resources.</p>

NOTE: A machine readable representation of a marking.</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> While policies requiring creators, processors, custodians, senders or recipients apply, enforce, and persist applicable Privacy Marks may be dictated by a jurisdiction, organization or personal privacy, security, or integrity policy, those required to comply may be governed under different policies, so compliance may need to be enforced through trust contracts. For example, information content marked with GDPR related policies may require adherence by processors or recipients outside of the European Union. For this reason, this code system is likely to evolve with the inclusion of multiple policy domains needing to communicate encoded policies in a standard, interoperable manner.</p>

See 42 CFR Â§ 2.32 Prohibition on re-disclosure. (a)Notice to accompany disclosure. Each disclosure made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by one of the following written statements: (1) This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by federal confidentiality rules ( 42 CFR part 2). The federal rules prohibit you from making any further disclosure of information in this record that identifies a patient as having or having had a substance use disorder either directly, by reference to publicly available information, or through verification of such identification by another person unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent of the individual whose information is being disclosed or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR part 2. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient for this purpose (see Â§ 2.31). The federal rules restrict any use of the information to investigate or prosecute with regard to a crime any patient with a substance use disorder, except as provided at Â§Â§ 2.12(c)(5) and 2.65; or (2) 42 CFR part 2 prohibits unauthorized disclosure of these records. https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/2.32</p>
<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Example of marking requirement from SAMHSA FAQ Response to question 13:</p>
<p>Would a logon or splash page notification on an HIOâ€™s portal that contains the Part 2 notice prohibiting redisclosure be sufficient to meet Part 2â€™s requirement that disclosures made with patient consent be accompanied by such a statement?</p>
<p>No. Part 2 requires each disclosure made with written patient consent to be accompanied by a written statement that the information disclosed is protected by federal law and that the recipient cannot make any further disclosure of it unless permitted by the regulations (42 CFR Â§ 2.32). A logon page is the page where a user logs onto a computer system; a splash page is an introductory page to a web site. A logon or splash page notification on a HIO's portal including the statement as required by Â§ 2.32 would not be sufficient notification regarding prohibitions on redisclosure since it would not accompany a specific disclosure. The notification must be tied to the Part 2 information being disclosed in order to ensure that the recipient of that information knows that specific information is protected by Part 2 and cannot be redisclosed except as authorized by the express written consent of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by Part 2. https://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/laws-regulations/confidentiality-regulations-faqs</p>

<p>Privacy metadata indicating highly sensitive, potentially stigmatizing information, which presents a high risk to the information subject if disclosed without authorization. May be pre-empted by jurisdictional law, e.g., for public health reporting or emergency treatment. Foundational definitions of Confidentiality: From HL7 Confidentiality Concept Domain: Types of privacy metadata classifying an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability) according to its level of sensitivity, which is based on an analysis of applicable privacy policies and the risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to an individual or entity that could result if made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.</p>
<p>Usage Note from HL7 Confidentiality code &quot;R&quot;: Confidentiality codes may be used in security labels and privacy markings to classify IT resources based on sensitivity to indicate the obligation of a custodian or receiver to ensure that the protected resource is not made available or disclosed to individuals, entities, or processes (security principals) unless authorized per applicable policies. Confidentiality codes may also be used in the clearances of initiators requesting access to protected resources.</p>
<p>This metadata indicates that the receiver may be obligated to comply with applicable, prevailing (default) jurisdictional privacy law or disclosure authorization.</p>
<p>Map: Definition aligns with ISO 7498-2:1989 - Confidentiality is the property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. Map: Partial Map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (3) Clinical Care: Default for normal clinical care access (i.e. most clinical staff directly caring for the patient should be able to access nearly all of the EHR).

<p>CUI Marking Handbook https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf</p>
<p>CUI Portion Marking: Portion marking of CUI is optional in a fully unclassified document, but is permitted and encouraged to facilitate information sharing and proper handling of the information. Agency heads may approve the required use of CUI Portion marking on all CUI generated within their agency. As such, users should consult their agency CUI policy when creating CUI documents. When CUI Portion Markings are used and a portion does not contain CUI a â€œUâ€? is placed in parentheses to indicate that the portion contains Uncontrolled Unclassified Information. (Page 14)</p>
<p>CUI Portion Markings are placed at the beginning of the portion to which they apply and must be used throughout the entire document. They are presented in all capital letters and separated as indicated in this handbook and the CUI Registry. The presence of EVEN ONE item of CUI in a document requires CUI marking of that document. Because of this, CUI Portion Markings can be of great assistance in determining if a document contains CUI and therefore must be marked as such. Remember: When portion markings are used and any portion does not contain CUI, a â€œ(U)â€? is placed in front of that portion to indicate that it contains Uncontrolled - or non-CUI - Unclassified Information.

<p>Low authentication level of assurance indicates that the relying party may have little or no confidence in the asserted identity's validity. Level 1 requires little or no confidence in the asserted identity. No identity proofing is required at this level, but the authentication mechanism should provide some assurance that the same claimant is accessing the protected transaction or data. A wide range of available authentication technologies can be employed and any of the token methods of Levels 2, 3, or 4, including Personal Identification Numbers (PINs), may be used. To be authenticated, the claimant must prove control of the token through a secure authentication protocol. At Level 1, long-term shared authentication secrets may be revealed to verifiers. Assertions issued about claimants as a result of a successful authentication are either cryptographically authenticated by relying parties (using approved methods) or are obtained directly from a trusted party via a secure authentication protocol.

<p>Basic authentication level of assurance indicates that the relying party may have some confidence in the asserted identity's validity. Level 2 requires confidence that the asserted identity is accurate. Level 2 provides for single-factor remote network authentication, including identity-proofing requirements for presentation of identifying materials or information. A wide range of available authentication technologies can be employed, including any of the token methods of Levels 3 or 4, as well as passwords. Successful authentication requires that the claimant prove through a secure authentication protocol that the claimant controls the token. Eavesdropper, replay, and online guessing attacks are prevented. Long-term shared authentication secrets, if used, are never revealed to any party except the claimant and verifiers operated by the CSP; however, session (temporary) shared secrets may be provided to independent verifiers by the CSP.

<p>Medium authentication level of assurance indicates that the relying party may have high confidence in the asserted identity's validity. Level 3 is appropriate for transactions that need high confidence in the accuracy of the asserted identity. Level 3 provides multifactor remote network authentication. At this level, identity-proofing procedures require verification of identifying materials and information. Authentication is based on proof of possession of a key or password through a cryptographic protocol. Cryptographic strength mechanisms should protect the primary authentication token (a cryptographic key) against compromise by the protocol threats, including eavesdropper, replay, online guessing, verifier impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks. A minimum of two authentication factors is required. Three kinds of tokens may be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;soft&quot; cryptographic token, which has the key stored on a general-purpose computer,</li>
<li>&quot;hard&quot; cryptographic token, which has the key stored on a special hardware device, and</li>
<li>&quot;one-time password&quot; device token, which has symmetric key stored on a personal hardware device that is a cryptographic module validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or higher. Validation testing of cryptographic modules and algorithms for conformance to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, is managed by NIST.</li>
</ul>
<p>Authentication requires that the claimant prove control of the token through a secure authentication protocol. The token must be unlocked with a password or biometric representation, or a password must be used in a secure authentication protocol, to establish two-factor authentication. Long-term shared authentication secrets, if used, are never revealed to any party except the claimant and verifiers operated directly by the CSP; however, session (temporary) shared secrets may be provided to independent verifiers by the CSP. Approved cryptographic techniques are used for all operations. Assertions issued about claimants as a result of a successful authentication are either cryptographically authenticated by relying parties (using approved methods) or are obtained directly from a trusted party via a secure authentication protocol.

<p>High authentication level of assurance indicates that the relying party may have very high confidence in the asserted identity's validity. Level 4 is for transactions that need very high confidence in the accuracy of the asserted identity. Level 4 provides the highest practical assurance of remote network authentication. Authentication is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. This level is similar to Level 3 except that only â€œhardâ€? cryptographic tokens are allowed, cryptographic module validation requirements are strengthened, and subsequent critical data transfers must be authenticated via a key that is bound to the authentication process. The token should be a hardware cryptographic module validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher overall with at least FIPS 140-2 Level 3 physical security. This level requires a physical token, which cannot readily be copied, and operator authentication at Level 2 and higher, and ensures good, two-factor remote authentication.</p>
<p>Level 4 requires strong cryptographic authentication of all parties and all sensitive data transfers between the parties. Either public key or symmetric key technology may be used. Authentication requires that the claimant prove through a secure authentication protocol that the claimant controls the token. Eavesdropper, replay, online guessing, verifier impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented. Long-term shared authentication secrets, if used, are never revealed to any party except the claimant and verifiers operated directly by the CSP; however, session (temporary) shared secrets may be provided to independent verifiers by the CSP.
