Age is generally used when the patient reports an age at which the procedure was performed. Range is generally used when the patient reports an age range when the procedure was performed, such as sometime between 20-25 years old.  dateTime supports a range of precision due to some procedures being reported as past procedures that might not have millisecond precision while other procedures performed and documented during the encounter might have more precise UTC timestamps with timezone.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension",0,*,"ele-1
