An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Before each step is executed and has preconditions these conditions are tested and if the test is positive, the Act has clearance for execution. The repeatNumber may indicate that an Act may be repeatedly executed. The checkpointCode is specifies when the precondition is checked and is analogous to the various conditional statements and loop constructs in programming languages ""while-do"" vs. ""do-while"" or ""repeat-until"" vs. ""loop-exit"".    For all checkpointCodes, except ""end"", preconditions are being checked at the time when the preceding step of the plan has terminated and this step would be next in the sequence established by the sequenceNumber attribute.    When the checkpointCode for a criterion of a repeatable Act is ""end"", the criterion is tested only at the end of each repetition of that Act. When the condition holds true, the next repetition is ready for execution.    When the checkpointCode is ""entry"" the criterion is checked at the beginning of each repetition (if any) whereas ""beginning"" means the criterion is checked only once before the repetition ""loop"" starts.    The checkpointCode ""through"" is special in that it requires the condition to hold throughout the execution of the Act, even throughout a single execution. As soon as the condition turns false, the Act should receive an interrupt event (see interruptibleInd) and will eventually terminate.    The checkpointCode ""exit"" is only used on a special plan step that represents a loop exit step. This allows an action plan to exit due to a condition tested inside the execution of this plan.

The joinCode then specifies if and how the braches are resynchronized.

A kill branch is only executed if there is at least one active wait (or exclusive wait) branch.

An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. The splitCode specifies whether a branch is executed exclusively (case-switch) or inclusively, i.e., in parallel with other branches.    In addition to exlusive and inclusive split the splitCode specifies how the pre-condition (also known as ""guard conditions"" on the branch) are evaluated. A guard condition may be evaluated once when the branching step is entered and if the conditions do not hold at that time, the branch is abandoned. Conversely execution of a branch may wait until the guard condition turns true.    In exclusive wait branches, the first branch whose guard conditions turn true will be executed and all other branches abandoned. In inclusive wait branches some branches may already be executed while other branches still wait for their guard conditions to turn true.","ValueSet/R5-v3-ActRelationshipSplitInclusiveWait-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-ActRelationshipSplitExclusiveWait-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-ActRelationshipSplitExclusiveTryOnce-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-ActRelationshipSplit-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-ActRelationshipSplitInclusiveTryOnce-for-R4"

Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that ethnicity is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with a particular ethnicity is preferred to observer identification.

The standards define a Hispanic or Latino as a person of ""Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central America, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.""

In the United States, federal standards for classifying data on race determine the categories used by federal agencies and exert a strong influence on categorization by state and local agencies and private sector organizations. The federal standards do not conceptually define race, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for racial classification. Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification. The standards use a variety of features to define five minimum race categories. Among these features are descent from ""the original peoples"" of a specified region or nation. The minimum race categories are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. The federal standards stipulate that race data need not be limited to the five minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories.","ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAsian-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianDelaware-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianArapaho-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianMaidu-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianYurok-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianChippewa-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianNavajo-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianLongIsland-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianCahuilla-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceSoutheastAlaskanIndian-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianPeoria-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianPueblo-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianWashoe-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanNativeAleutAlutiiq-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceNativeAmerican-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceWhiteMiddleEast-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-Wiyot-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianPima-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RacePacificIslandMicronesian-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianPomo-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-Yaqui-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndian-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianGrosVentres-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianChemakuan-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianShoshone-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-Catawba-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanNativeAleutBristolBay-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanNativeAleutUnangan-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RacePacificIslandPolynesian-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianHoopa-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianWampanoag-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianWinnebago-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianIroquois-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianSeminole-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceHawaiianOrPacificIsland-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAfricanAmericanAfrican-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanNative-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianMiami-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianChinook-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianChippewaCree-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RacePacificIslandMelanesian-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianMicmac-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanIndianAthabascan-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianSerrano-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianCheyenne-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceWhite-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianYuman-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianPotawatomi-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianChoctaw-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianUte-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-Yokuts-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianCoushatta-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanNativeSiberianEskimo-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceBlackOrAfricanAmerican-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianPugetSoundSalish-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianTohonoOOdham-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-Race-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianSioux-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceSoutheastAlaskanIndianTlingit-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianIowa-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianPassamaquoddy-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianPequot-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianApache-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianCupeno-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianCreek-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianSacFox-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceSoutheastAlaskanIndianTsimshian-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianPonca-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanNativeAleutKoniag-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceCanadianLatinIndian-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceWhiteEuropean-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanNativeEskimo-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianChumash-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianComanche-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianKlallam-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanNativeAleutChugach-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianKiowa-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianAssiniboineSioux-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianChickahominy-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceWhiteArab-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanNativeAleut-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianOttawa-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianDiegueno-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianCherokee-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianPaiute-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianUmpqua-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanIndian-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianNorthwestTribes-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianCalifornia-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanNativeYupikEskimo-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAlaskanNativeInupiatEskimo-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianEasternTribes-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianShawnee-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianShoshonePaiute-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianLuiseno-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianKickapoo-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianCaddo-for-R4,ValueSet/R5-v3-RaceAmericanIndianPawnee-for-R4"

The values in this hierarchy, represent a Role which is an association or relationship between two entities - the entity that plays the role and the entity that scopes the role. Roles names are derived from the name of the playing entity in that role.    The role hierarchy stems from three core concepts, or abstract domains:     *  **RoleClassOntological** is an abstract domain that collects roles in which the playing entity is defined or specified by the scoping entity.   *  **RoleClassPartitive** collects roles in which the playing entity is in some sense a ""part"" of the scoping entity.   *  **RoleClassAssociative** collects all of the remaining forms of association between the playing entity and the scoping entity. This set of roles is further partitioned between:             *  **RoleClassPassive** which are roles in which the playing entity is used, known, treated, handled, built, or destroyed, etc. under the auspices of the scoping entity. The playing entity is passive in these roles in that the role exists without an agreement from the playing entity.       *  **RoleClassMutualRelationship** which are relationships based on mutual behavior of the two entities. The basis of these relationship may be formal agreements or they may be *de facto* behavior. Thus, this sub-domain is further divided into:                     *  **RoleClassRelationshipFormal** in which the relationship is formally defined, frequently by a contract or agreement.           *  **Personal relationship** which inks two people in a personal relationship.    The hierarchy discussed above is represented In the current vocabulary tables as a set of abstract domains, with the exception of the ""Personal relationship"" which is a leaf concept.    *OpenIssue:* Description copied from Concept Domain of same name.

This code system is partitioned into three sections: Affiliate realms, Binding realms and Namespace realms. All affiliate realm codes may automatically be used as both binding realms and namespace realms. Furthermore, affiliate realms are the only realms that have authority over the creation of binding realms. (Note that 'affiliate' includes the idea of both international affiliates and the HL7 International organization.) All other codes must be associated with an owning affiliate realm and must appear as a specialization of \_BindingRealm or \_NamespaceRealm. For affiliates whose concepts align with nations, the country codes from ISO 3166-1 2-character alpha are used for the code when possible so these codes should not be used for other realm types. It is recommended that binding realm and namespace codes submitted by affiliates use the realm code as a prefix to avoid possible collisions with ISO codes. However, tooling does not currently support namepace realm codes greater than 2 characters.    *Open Issue:* The name of the concept property ""owningAffiliate"" should be changed to better reflect that the property value is the human readable name of the organizational entity that manages the Realm identified by the Realm Code.    *Open Issue:* In spite of the inability of tooling to process codes longer than 2 characters, there is at least one realm codes ('SOA') that was added that is 3 characters in length.","ValueSet/R5-v3-BindingRealm-for-R4"
