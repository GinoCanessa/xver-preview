A claimant must be either a person or organization, or a group of persons or organizations. A claimant is not a named insured or a program eligible.</p>\n<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> With respect to liability insurance such as property and casualty insurance, a claimant must file a claim requesting indemnification for a loss that the claimant considers covered under the policy of a named insured. The claims adjuster for the policy underwriter will review the claim to determine whether the loss meets the benefit coverage criteria under a policy, and base any indemnification or coverage payment on that review. If a third party is liable in whole or part for the loss, the underwriter may pursue third party liability recovery. A claimant may be involved in civil or criminal legal proceedings involving claims against a defendant party that is indemnified by an insurance policy or to protest the finding of a claims adjustor. With respect to life insurance, a beneficiary designated by a named insured becomes a claimant of the proceeds of coverage, as in the case of a life insurance policy. However, a claimant for coverage under life insurance is not necessarily a designated beneficiary.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> A claimant is not a named insured. However, a named insured may make a claim under a policy, e.g., an insured driver may make a claim for an injury under his or her comprehensive automobile insurance policy. Similarly, a program eligible may make a claim under program, e.g., an unemployed worker may claim benefits under an unemployment insurance program, but parties playing these covered party role classes are not, for purposes of this vocabulary and in an effort to clearly distinguish role classes, considered claimants.</p>\n<p>In the case of a named insured making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that either a named insured or an individual insured has filed a claim for a loss. In the case of a program eligible, a role type code INJWKR (injured worker) subtypes the class to indicate that the covered party in a workers compensation program is an injured worker, and as such, has filed a &quot;claim&quot; under the program for benefits. Likewise, a covered role type code UNEMP (unemployed worker) subtypes the program eligible class to indicate that the covered party in an unemployment insurance program has filed a claim for unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A claimant under automobile policy that is not the named insured.</p>\n</div></td></tr><tr><td><a name=\"R5-v3-RoleClassCoveredParty-for-R4-http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-RoleClass-COVPTY\"> </a><code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-RoleClass</code></td><td>3.1.0</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-RoleClass.html#v3-RoleClass-COVPTY\">COVPTY</a></td><td>covered party</td><td><div><p>A role class played by a person who receives benefit coverage under the terms of a particular insurance policy.

However, a dependent may make a claim under a policy, e.g., a dependent under a health insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy for wellness examines or if injured and there is no liable third party. In the case of a dependent making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that the dependent has filed a claim for services covered under the health insurance policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> The dependent has an association with the subscriber such as a financial dependency or personal relationship such as that of a spouse, or a natural or adopted child. The policy holder may be required by law to recognize certain associations or may have discretion about the associations. For example, a policy holder may dictate the criteria for the dependent status of adult children who are students, such as requiring full time enrollment, or may recognize domestic partners as dependents. Under certain circumstances, the dependent may be under the indirect authority of a responsible party acting as a surrogate for the subscriber, for example, if the subscriber is differently abled or deceased, a guardian ad Lidem or estate executor may be appointed to assume the subscriberaTMs legal standing in the relationship with the dependent.</p>\n</div></td></tr><tr><td><a name=\"R5-v3-RoleClassCoveredParty-for-R4-http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-RoleClass-INDIV\"> </a><code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-RoleClass</code></td><td>3.1.0</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-RoleClass.html#v3-RoleClass-INDIV\">INDIV</a></td><td>individual</td><td><div><p><strong>Description:</strong> A role played by a party covered under a policy as the policy holder.
