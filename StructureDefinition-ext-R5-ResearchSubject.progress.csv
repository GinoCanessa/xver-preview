","Subject status","The current state (status) of the subject and resons for status change where appropriate.","This is intended to deal with the confusion routinely created by haing two conflated concepts of being in a particular state and having achieved a particular milestone.  In strict terms a milestone is a point of time event that results in a change from one state to another.  The state before the milestone is achieved is often given the same name as the milestone, and sometimes the state may have the same description.  For instance ""Randomised"" and ""Visit 1"" may be different milestones but the state remains at ""on study"" after each of them. 

It is likely that more than one ""state"" pattern will be recorded for a subject and a type has been introduced to allow this simultaneous recording.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension",0,*,"ele-1
